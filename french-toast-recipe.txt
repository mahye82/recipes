Ingredients:
- 1 egg per piece of toast
- Dry bread
- Vegetable oil, bacon drippings, lard or butter
- Salt and black pepper (optional)

Directions:
1. Use a flat bowl large enough to hold three eggs scrambled. Break eggs into 
bowl. Add pinch of salt or less, and pepper (use plenty of black pepper).

2. Use fork to break eggs, mixing to the point where the eggs are almost 
completely mixed, but when you can still see some yellow and white.

3. Head a pan/skillet. Add vegetable oil, bacon drippings, lard or butter. 
Heat enough so that the bottom of pan is barely covered when melted. Allow 
pan to heat oil or butter until point just before it starts smoking, i.e. you
can see some movement of the liquid.

4. Take bread (should be dry but not hard) and dunk them in the bowl of eggs.
Let bread soak in the egg mixture, then flip over on the other side and repeat.
When bread is soaked, remove from bowl using tongs or a fork. 

5. Place bread in pan and fry. Raise a corner to check that the bread is 
slightly browned. Flip the bread in the pan until brown on that side as well.

6. Remove from pan and enjoy.
